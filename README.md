# Projects
Hello! This repo contains some of the projects I have completed over the years. 

# Traveling Sales Person
A C++ project that implements a solver for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

The input to the problem is a collection of n points in the plane. The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest path that visists every point exactly once and returns to the starting point. That is, we are looking for a cyccle in the graph that visits each vertex exactly once, such that the total length is as small as possible. For this problem, I applied the "nearest next point heuristic". 

The main file will output 5 tests. Each test will display the list of points (if there are 20 or less points), a drawing of the points (if there are 20 or less points), and the solution to the problem. 

# Binary Tree Implementation
Part 1 gets a binary tree representing an arithmetic expression and returns the evaluation of the expression. 

Part 2 gets a binary search tree and returns the maximal element. A seperate function also returns the median element in the tree. For example, if the tree contains (1, 3, 6, 8, 100), the output is 6.
