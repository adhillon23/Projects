# Project
A C++ project that implements a solver for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

# Traveling Sales Person
The input to the problem is a collection of n points in the plane. The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest path that visists every point exactly once and returns to the starting point. That is, we are looking for a cyccle in the graph that visits each vertex exactly once, such that the total length is as small as possible. For this problem, I applied the "nearest next point heuristic".
